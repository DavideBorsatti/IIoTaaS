# PoC Material for "Enabling Industrial IoT as a Service with Multi-access Edge Computing" 

The code for the MEC Platform and MEC Application is based on [Unibo Test MEC](https://github.com/berdav/unibo-test-mec). The same installation instructions apply. While for the FOG Orchestrator the solution used is UniBo [GAUChO: FORCH](https://github.com/giditre/unibo_gaucho)

TODO: Explain in details the step to deploy and test the PoC
